## Introduction


An invstigation on a kaggle synthetic credit card dataset for fraudulent activity using machine learning methods which included Logistic regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost. Further exploratory analysis was done along with investigating the effectiveness of PCA on the dataset

## Instructions

The report and entire colab in python can be found within the folder
- Fulldetailed report on exploraton and results in Card Fraud Report.pdf
- Full colab python file avalible in CardFraud.ipynb
- The jupyter notebook firsty contains exploratorty analysis and checks for multicolinarity 
- followed by PCA and its relavance
- Finally machine learning approches along with thier respective results
